One day she notices that all the library books she has have been previously checked out by the same person: \u0027Seiji Amasawa\u0027. Curious as to who he is, Shizuku meets a boy her age whom she finds infuriating, but discovers to her shock that he is her \u0027Prince of Books\u0027. As she grows closer to him, she realises that he merely read all those books to bring himself closer to her.

Knowing that her strength lies in writing, she tests her talents by writing a story about Baron, a cat statuette belonging to Seiji\u0027s grandfather",

A secretive, nefarious agency seeks to control the culture. They do this by covertly staging reproductions of everyday events, and by so doing, undermining the moment’s originality and currency. Society is then left to puzzle over what might be real, and what is fake. The agency employs symbols—like the fascists, like imperial powers of the past—notably a red cone, to plant their flag upon the moment.  Two agents, Kathryn and Mason, exhausted by the toll each removal has taken from them, quietly, and then overtly, set out to undermine the agency.  Haunting, engaging, and with a ferocity of vision that calls to mind the cerebral thrillers of Shane Carruth, David Lynch, or Andrei Tarkovsky, Nicholas Rombes’s directorial debut is a spellbinding new work and apt analogy for the wormhole where modern social communication leads.",

At least that’s the legend residents have always believed.

The Boxtrolls have raised an orphaned human boy since infancy as one of their dumpster-diving and mechanical junk-collecting own. When the Boxtrolls are targeted by a villainous pest exterminator who is bent on eradicating them as his ticket to Cheesebridge society, the kind-hearted band of tinkerers must turn to their adopted charge and an adventurous rich girl to bridge two worlds amidst the winds of change – and cheese.",
